Love in the Time of Spaceships

A 48 hour game by Philip Hazelden
Entered into Reddit Game Jam 5: http://redd.it/ez5b6

Would you take a bullet for your wife? Pilot your spaceship into the red dots so
that they don't get past you to hit her. Green dots will replenish your shields,
but not hers. If you die, she doesn't stand a chance.
